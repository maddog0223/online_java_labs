Answer the following questions:

1.) What is the if statement used for?

    To change of the flow of the execution.

2.) What is good real life application of a switch statement?

    Months, days, weeks, # of floors.
    When the outcome has finite numbers.

3.) What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?

    do-while-- THe body of the loop gets checked before the while condition
    while loop-- THe body of the loop is checked after the while condition, so if the condition is false, the
    body of the loop never gets checked.

4.) What is the difference between a for loop and an enhanced for loop?

    For loop -- Used to iterate values to repeat a sequence code
    Enhanced/ For-each loop -- Used to iterate collection of variables (ex:array)

5.) How do you create an infinite for loop?

    keep the condition empty

6.) What is the difference between the break statement and the continue statement?

    break -- Used to get out of the loop
    continue -- Forces an early iteration. Skips the targeted iteration. The continues on to the next iteration.

7.) Is there a limit to how many loops you can nest?

    no but the nested loop can get confusing.
    The loop nested inside the outer loop has to be executed completely for the outer loop to go to the next iteration.

8.) Is there a limit to how many conditional statements you can nest?

    No
