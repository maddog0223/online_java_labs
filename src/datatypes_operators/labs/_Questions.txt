Answer the following questions:


1.) What are the names and uses of Java's eight primitive types?

double -- double-precision float point---3.53847593487538947
float -- single- precision float point---3.4343434343
int -- integer---343243423
byte -- 8-bit integer---343
short -- short integer---43432
long -- long integer---342342354524524
char -- character---'a'
boolean -- true/false

2.) How do you declare and initialize an int variable called "x" with the value 42.

int x = 42;

3.) What happens if you initialize a double variable with the value of a int?

widening
automatic conversion

4.) How do you set an int variable to the value of a double?

casting

double y;

int x = (int) y;

5.) What are the 5 arithmetic operators?

+ add
- subtract
* multiply
/ divide
% modulus (the remainder of division)

6.) What are Relational operators used for? What is the result of using a relational operator?

-- Used to show the relations of values by using = =, !=, >,<, <=, or >=
-- Results a true or a false

7.) Demonstrate the use of a Relational operator.

int a = 1;
int b = 2;

if (a!=b) System.out.print ("a is not b");

8.) What logical operators used for? What is the result of using a logical operator?

-- Used to show the relations of values with &, |, ^, ||, &&, or!
-- Results true or a false
-- inequality ot equality relation

9.) Demonstrate the use of a logical operator.

p = false
q= true

if (p&q) System.out.println( "false");

^^^will not execute

if (q^p) System.out.print("true");

^^^ will execute

10.) How can you use the shorthand addition operator to add 10 to a variable "x"?

x += 10;

11.) What data type is a String?

-- not a primitive data type
-- It is an object type

12.) Are string mutable?

Strings are not mutable (immutable --unchangeable after being created)

13.) How do you concatenate Strings?

can concatenate with a + operator

System.out.print("hi" + "bye");

14.) Can you cast and int to a String or a String to an int? Why or why not?

You can't cast String to int and vice versa
String is an object type
int is a primitive
They are not the same data type


15.) What is an array?

A collection of variables of the same type
Arrays are objects

16.) What is the first index of an array?

0


17.) Can you change the size of an array once it has been declared and initialized?

No, Arrays are fixed

18.) How do you print the 5th element in an array "exampleArray"?

int [] exampleArray = int [7];

int a = exampleArray[4];


19.) What are the two ways you can declare and initialize an array? Demonstrate both.

1-- int [] example1 = new int [4];
2 -- int [] example2 = {1,2,3,4};

20.) How do you iterate through a multidimensional array?

1--int [][] multdex = new int [5][10];

2--int [][] = multdex = {
{1,2,3,4,},
{2,4,6,8},
{3,6,9,12}
};

3-- iterate through array:

for ( int i = 0; i < multdex.length; i++) {

    for ( int x = 0; x < multdex[i].length; x++) {

        System.out.println ( multdex[i][x]);

    }

}

4 -- iterate through array (for each loop)

for( int[] arr : multdex) {

    for (int val : arr) {

        System.out.println(val);

    }

}

21.) What is the for-each loop used for?

iterate over a collection of variables.
