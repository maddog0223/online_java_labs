Answer the following questions:

1.) What is inheritance?

When a class(subclass) is able to access all the methods and traits from another class (parent class).

2.) Why do we use inheritance?

Reduces many functional issue. This is because inheritance allow codes to be used;
therefore, it makes the program more efficient as well.

3.) Provide a real world example where you think inheritance would be implemented.

Working in a car company

Subaru extends Vehicle

4.) How does a class inherit another class?

class a extends class b
>>class a is now a subclass of class b

5.) How many levels can a hierarchy extend?

infinity (but not recommended)

6.) What is the "super" keyword used for?

A reference to the variables of parent class

7.) When a subclass object is created, in what order do the constructors execute?

The parent class is executed before the subclass

8.) What is method overwriting?

A class declaring the same exact method from another class

9.) How can method overwriting be beneficial?

This makes coding more productive and efficient

When you want the general method to be to same, but want to tweak it a little.

example -- A car and a motorcycle can drive by starting the engine;
however, how they start the engine is a bit different

Creating a new method each time for a different vehicle can be time consuming and confusing.
Creating an overwrite method can help you tweak inside the method that was overwritten and
